## Theory
A Non-Inverting Amplifier is a closed-loop amplifier configuration in which the input is applied to the non-inverting terminal (+) of the op-amp.
The output signal is amplified and remains in phase with the input signal.
## Procedure

•	Output is amplified without phase reversal.
•	Practical values are close to theoretical values.
## Viva Questions
1.	What is a Non-Inverting Amplifier?

• A Non-Inverting Amplifier is an op-amp configuration in which the input signal is applied to the non-inverting terminal (+) and the output is taken from the output pin. The output signal is amplified and remains in phase with the input signal.

2.	What is the gain formula?

•Av​=1+R1​/Rf​​

3.	Why is output in phase?

•Because the input is applied to the non-inverting terminal (+) of the op-amp. Therefore, the output signal has 0° phase shift (no inversion).

4.	What happens if Rf increases?

If 𝑅𝑓 increases:

𝐴𝑣 =1+𝑅𝑓/𝑅1​

The gain increases.
So, the output voltage increase

5.	What is the input impedance of non-inverting amplifier?
•The input impedance is very high (ideally infinite) because the input is applied directly to the op-amp terminal.

•High input impedance means:

•It does not load the signal source.

•Very small input current flows.
